# Inventory Management System

c# Problem:
The program manages an inventory system where products are added, sold, and archived. The system saves and loads its state using file persistence, so data is retained across program restarts.

# Key Features:
- ArrayList: Stores items currently in stock.
- Array: Archives sold-out items.
- File Persistence: Saves and loads inventory and archived items to/from files.
- Recursion: Used for validating integer input from the user.
- Exception Handling: Handles invalid input, file errors, and other exceptions.

# How to Run:
1. Run Main.java in the command line.
3. The program will present a menu for managing inventory.

# Example:
- Add new items
- View current inventory
- Sell items and move sold-out items to the archive
